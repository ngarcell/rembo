## Background Context

Kenya's matatu industry, a vital component of the country's public transportation system, currently operates through largely manual processes that create inefficiencies, limit transparency, and provide suboptimal customer experiences. Fleet operators struggle with real-time visibility into their vehicles, passengers face uncertainty about schedules and availability, and the entire ecosystem lacks the digital infrastructure needed for modern transportation management.

This system addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive digital platform that modernizes matatu operations through integrated booking, GPS-based fleet tracking, mobile payments, and AI-powered optimization. The solution targets the gap between traditional matatu operations and the digital expectations of modern passengers while providing fleet operators with the tools needed to run efficient, profitable operations.
