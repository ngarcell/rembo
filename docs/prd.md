# AI-Powered Matatu Fleet Management & Route Optimization System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* **Digitize Operations**: Transform manual matatu fleet operations into a digital-first system with real-time visibility and control
* **Enable Digital Payments**: Implement seamless seat booking and fare payment via M-Pesa integration
* **Optimize Fleet Efficiency**: Use AI-powered route optimization and fleet management to maximize utilization and reduce operational costs
* **Provide Management Tools**: Deliver comprehensive tools for administrators and managers to handle drivers, vehicles, and trips effectively
* **Generate Business Intelligence**: Provide actionable reports and insights for data-driven decision making
* **Improve Customer Experience**: Offer passengers a modern, reliable booking and tracking experience

### Background Context

Kenya's matatu industry, a vital component of the country's public transportation system, currently operates through largely manual processes that create inefficiencies, limit transparency, and provide suboptimal customer experiences. Fleet operators struggle with real-time visibility into their vehicles, passengers face uncertainty about schedules and availability, and the entire ecosystem lacks the digital infrastructure needed for modern transportation management.

This system addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive digital platform that modernizes matatu operations through integrated booking, GPS-based fleet tracking, mobile payments, and AI-powered optimization. The solution targets the gap between traditional matatu operations and the digital expectations of modern passengers while providing fleet operators with the tools needed to run efficient, profitable operations.
