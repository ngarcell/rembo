# Epic 1: User Authentication & Account Management

**Epic Goal**: Establish secure, role-based user authentication and account management system

## Overview
This epic focuses on implementing the foundational authentication and user management system that supports three distinct user roles: Admin, Manager, and Passenger. The system will use phone number-based authentication through Supabase Auth and provide role-based access control throughout the application.

## User Stories

### US1.1: Passenger Registration
**As a passenger, I want to sign up using my phone number so that I can access the booking system**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can enter phone number in international format
- System sends OTP via SMS for verification
- User can complete registration with OTP verification
- System creates passenger profile with basic information
- User receives welcome message upon successful registration

**Technical Requirements:**
- Integrate with Supabase Auth phone authentication
- Implement OTP verification flow
- Create user profile in database with passenger role
- Handle duplicate phone number scenarios

### US1.2: Passenger Login
**As a passenger, I want to login securely so that I can access my account and booking history**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can login with phone number and OTP
- System maintains secure session with JWT tokens
- User can access personalized dashboard after login
- System handles session expiry gracefully
- User can logout securely

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement secure JWT token management
- Create session management middleware
- Handle token refresh automatically
- Implement secure logout functionality

### US1.3: Admin Account Management
**As an admin, I want to manage manager accounts so that I can control system access**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can create new manager accounts
- Admin can view list of all managers
- Admin can activate/deactivate manager accounts
- Admin can assign managers to specific fleets
- Admin can reset manager passwords/access

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement admin-only endpoints for user management
- Create manager account creation workflow
- Implement role-based access control middleware
- Add audit logging for admin actions

### US1.4: Manager Driver Registration
**As a manager, I want to register drivers so that I can assign them to vehicles**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Manager can create driver profiles with personal details
- System auto-generates unique driver IDs
- Manager can upload driver license and documents
- Driver receives credentials to access system
- Manager can view all drivers in their fleet

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement driver registration API endpoints
- Create unique driver ID generation algorithm
- Add file upload capability for documents
- Implement fleet-based access control

### US1.5: System Driver ID Generation
**As a system, I want to auto-generate unique driver IDs so that each driver has a traceable identifier**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System generates IDs in format DRV-XXXYYY
- XXX is sequential driver number within fleet
- YYY is fleet identifier code
- IDs are unique across entire system
- ID generation is atomic and thread-safe

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement atomic ID generation with database sequences
- Create fleet-based numbering system
- Add uniqueness constraints in database
- Handle concurrent registration scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user stories implemented and tested
- [ ] Authentication flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Dependencies
- Supabase Auth configuration
- SMS provider setup (Africa's Talking)
- Database schema for user management
- Frontend authentication components

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: SMS delivery failures
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback SMS providers
- **Risk**: Concurrent driver ID generation
  - **Mitigation**: Use database sequences and proper locking
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in auth flow
  - **Mitigation**: Security audit and penetration testing

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points**: 21
**Duration**: 2-3 sprints
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Foundation for all other features)
