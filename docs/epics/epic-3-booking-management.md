# Epic 3: Booking & Trip Management

**Epic Goal**: Enable passengers to book trips and managers to manage trip operations

## Overview
This epic implements the core booking system that allows passengers to view available trips, make seat reservations, and enables managers to create and manage trip schedules. It includes real-time seat inventory management and overbooking prevention.

## User Stories

### US3.1: Trip Discovery
**As a passenger, I want to view available trips so that I can plan my journey**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Passenger can search trips by route and date
- System shows real-time seat availability
- Trip details include departure time, fare, and vehicle info
- Search results are sorted by relevance and time
- System handles no-results scenarios gracefully

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create trip search API with filtering
- Implement real-time seat availability calculation
- Add route-based search functionality
- Create responsive trip listing interface
- Implement search result caching for performance

### US3.2: Seat Booking
**As a passenger, I want to book seats for trips so that I can secure my transportation**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Passenger can select number of seats to book
- System prevents overbooking with real-time validation
- Booking confirmation provided immediately
- Seat reservation held during payment process
- Booking details accessible in passenger dashboard

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement atomic seat reservation system
- Create booking confirmation workflow
- Add seat inventory management with locking
- Implement booking timeout for unpaid reservations
- Create booking management interface

### US3.3: Trip Management
**As a manager, I want to create and manage trips so that I can serve passengers**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Manager can create trips with schedule and pricing
- System validates vehicle availability for trip times
- Manager can modify trip details before departure
- Trip status tracking (scheduled, in-progress, completed)
- Manager can cancel trips with passenger notifications

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create trip creation and management APIs
- Implement vehicle availability validation
- Add trip status management workflow
- Create manager trip dashboard
- Implement trip modification and cancellation logic

### US3.4: Overbooking Prevention
**As a system, I want to prevent overbooking so that passenger experience is maintained**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System enforces seat capacity limits atomically
- Concurrent booking attempts handled correctly
- Seat inventory updated in real-time
- Booking conflicts resolved automatically
- System maintains data consistency under load

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement atomic seat reservation with database locks
- Add concurrent booking conflict resolution
- Create real-time inventory management system
- Implement booking validation middleware
- Add stress testing for concurrent scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Trip search and discovery functional
- [ ] Seat booking system operational
- [ ] Trip management dashboard complete
- [ ] Overbooking prevention tested and verified
- [ ] Real-time inventory management working
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Load testing completed

## Dependencies
- Epic 1: Authentication (for passenger and manager roles)
- Epic 2: Fleet Management (for vehicle data)
- Database schema for trips and bookings
- Payment system integration (Epic 4)

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Routes
routes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  origin VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  distance_km DECIMAL(8,2),
  estimated_duration_minutes INTEGER,
  base_fare DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Trips
trips (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  route_id UUID REFERENCES routes(id),
  vehicle_id UUID REFERENCES vehicles(id),
  driver_id UUID REFERENCES drivers(id),
  scheduled_departure TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  scheduled_arrival TIMESTAMP,
  status trip_status DEFAULT 'scheduled',
  fare DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  available_seats INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Bookings
bookings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  trip_id UUID REFERENCES trips(id),
  passenger_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  seats_booked INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  booking_status booking_status DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/trips/search` - Search available trips
- `POST /api/bookings/reserve` - Reserve seats for trip
- `GET /api/bookings/user/{id}` - Get user bookings
- `POST /api/trips` - Create new trip (manager)
- `PUT /api/trips/{id}` - Update trip details
- `DELETE /api/trips/{id}` - Cancel trip

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Race conditions in seat booking
  - **Mitigation**: Use database transactions with proper isolation levels
- **Risk**: Performance issues with real-time inventory
  - **Mitigation**: Implement caching and optimize database queries
- **Risk**: Complex booking state management
  - **Mitigation**: Use state machines and comprehensive testing

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points**: 24
**Duration**: 3 sprints
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Core business functionality)
