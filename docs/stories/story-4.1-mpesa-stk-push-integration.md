## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Payment transactions table
CREATE TABLE payment_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    booking_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES bookings(id),
    
    -- M-Pesa specific fields
    checkout_request_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    merchant_request_id VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
    
    -- Transaction tracking
    mpesa_receipt_number VARCHAR(100),
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP,
    status payment_status DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    
    -- Metadata
    account_reference VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_desc TEXT,
    
    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '2 minutes')
);

-- Payment status enum
CREATE TYPE payment_status AS ENUM (
    'PENDING',
    'PROCESSING', 
    'COMPLETED',
    'FAILED',
    'CANCELLED',
    'EXPIRED',
    'REFUNDED'
);
```

### API Endpoints
```python
# Payment initiation
POST /api/v1/payments/initiate
{
    "booking_id": "uuid",
    "phone_number": "254708374149",
    "amount": 500.00
}

# Payment status check
GET /api/v1/payments/{payment_id}/status

# M-Pesa callback webhook
POST /api/v1/payments/mpesa/callback
```

### Service Implementation
```python
class MpesaPaymentService:
    async def initiate_stk_push(self, booking_id: UUID, phone: str, amount: Decimal):
        # Generate payment reference
        # Call M-Pesa STK Push API
        # Store payment transaction
        # Return checkout request ID
        
    async def handle_callback(self, callback_data: dict):
        # Verify callback signature
        # Update payment status
        # Confirm booking if successful
        # Trigger receipt generation
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
