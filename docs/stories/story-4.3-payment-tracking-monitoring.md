        # Calculate trends and comparisons
        # Generate analytics insights
        # Cache results for performance

    async def check_alert_conditions(self):
        # Evaluate all active alerts
        # Identify triggered conditions
        # Send notifications
        # Log alert activities
        
class ReconciliationService:
    async def reconcile_payments(self, date: datetime, fleet_id: UUID):
        # Fetch system payment records
        # Import M-Pesa statement data
        # Match transactions
        # Identify discrepancies
        # Generate reconciliation report
