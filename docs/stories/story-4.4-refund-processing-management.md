    "refund_reason": "TRIP_CANCELLED_BY_OPERATOR",
    "refund_amount": 450.00,
    "notes": "Trip cancelled due to vehicle breakdown"
}

# Approve refund
POST /api/v1/refunds/{refund_id}/approve

# Get refund status
GET /api/v1/refunds/{refund_id}/status

# List refunds
GET /api/v1/refunds
?status=PENDING&date_from=2024-01-01

# M-Pesa B2C callback

    async def initiate_refund(self, booking_id: UUID, reason: str, amount: Decimal):
        # Validate refund eligibility
        # Calculate refund amount based on policy
        # Check approval requirements
        # Create refund transaction
        # Trigger processing if auto-approved
        
    async def process_refund(self, refund_id: UUID):
        # Validate refund status
        # Call M-Pesa B2C API
        # Update refund status
        # Generate refund receipt
        # Send notifications
        
    async def handle_b2c_callback(self, callback_data: dict):
        # Verify callback authenticity
        # Update refund status
        # Generate completion notifications
        # Update booking status
        
class RefundPolicyService:
    async def calculate_refund_amount(self, booking_id: UUID, reason: str) -> Decimal:
        # Get applicable refund policy
        # Calculate refund based on timing and reason
        # Apply any additional rules
        # Return calculated amount
```
