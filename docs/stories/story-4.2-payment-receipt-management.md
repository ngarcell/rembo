## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Receipt management table
CREATE TABLE payment_receipts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    payment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES payment_transactions(id),
    
    -- Receipt identification
    receipt_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    receipt_type receipt_type DEFAULT 'PAYMENT',
    
    -- File management
    pdf_file_path TEXT,
    pdf_file_size INTEGER,
    qr_code_data TEXT,
    
    -- Delivery tracking
    email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    email_sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    sms_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    sms_sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Verification
    verification_hash VARCHAR(256),
    verification_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_verified_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Receipt type enum
CREATE TYPE receipt_type AS ENUM (
    'PAYMENT',
    'REFUND',
    'CANCELLATION'
);
```

### API Endpoints
```python
# Generate receipt
POST /api/v1/receipts/generate
{
    "payment_id": "uuid",
    "delivery_method": ["email", "sms"]
}

# Get receipt
GET /api/v1/receipts/{receipt_id}

# Download receipt PDF
GET /api/v1/receipts/{receipt_id}/download

# Verify receipt
POST /api/v1/receipts/verify
{
    "qr_code_data": "encrypted_receipt_data"
}

# Resend receipt
POST /api/v1/receipts/{receipt_id}/resend
```

### Service Implementation
```python
class ReceiptService:
    async def generate_receipt(self, payment_id: UUID, delivery_methods: List[str]):
        # Fetch payment and booking details
        # Generate unique receipt number
        # Create PDF with template
        # Generate QR code
        # Store receipt record
        # Trigger delivery
        
    async def deliver_receipt(self, receipt_id: UUID, methods: List[str]):
        # Send via email if requested
        # Send via SMS if requested
        # Update delivery status
        # Handle delivery failures
        
    async def verify_receipt(self, qr_data: str) -> dict:
        # Decode QR data
        # Verify receipt authenticity
        # Return verification result
```

## Testing Requirements
