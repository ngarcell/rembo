# Deployment Architecture

## Environment Strategy
* **Development**: Local Docker Compose setup
* **Staging**: Render.com with reduced resources
* **Production**: Render.com with auto-scaling enabled

## Container Architecture
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for Python services
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
