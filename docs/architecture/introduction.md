# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the AI-Powered Matatu Fleet Management & Route Optimization System, including backend systems, shared services, and frontend components. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

The architecture is designed to support a multi-tenant SaaS platform that serves three distinct user types (Admins, Managers, Passengers) with real-time GPS tracking, payment processing, and fleet management capabilities.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project that will be built from scratch using modern web technologies. No existing starter template will be used, allowing for custom architecture optimized for the specific requirements of matatu fleet management.
