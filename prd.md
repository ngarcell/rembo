Got it âœ… â€” Iâ€™ll reframe your draft into a \*\*clean, professional PRD\*\* thatâ€™s structured, concise, and clear enough for developers (Augment, Cursor, GitHub, etc.) to implement without ambiguity.

\# ðŸ“„ Product Requirements Document (PRD)



\*\*AI-Powered Matatu Fleet Management \& Route Optimization System\*\*



---



\## 1. Goals \& Background



\### Goals



\* Digitize matatu fleet operations with real-time visibility and control.

\* Enable seat booking and fare payment via M-Pesa.

\* Optimize routes and fleet usage with AI.

\* Provide tools for administrators and managers to handle drivers, vehicles, and trips.

\* Deliver actionable reports and insights for business intelligence.



\### Background



Kenyaâ€™s matatu industry relies heavily on manual operations, which limits efficiency, transparency, and customer experience. This system modernizes operations with digital booking, GPS-based fleet tracking, integrated payments, and AI-powered optimization.

\## 2. User Roles



1\. \*\*Admin\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Manages all accounts (managers, drivers, passengers).

&nbsp;  \* Configures fare policies, routes, and system settings.

&nbsp;  \* Full access to reports and kill-switch for compromised assets.



2\. \*\*Manager\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Registers and manages drivers \& vehicles.

&nbsp;  \* Assigns drivers to vehicles.

&nbsp;  \* Monitors trips, vehicle locations, and revenue.

&nbsp;  \* Exports reports (CSV).



3\. \*\*User (Passenger)\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Signs up with phone number.

&nbsp;  \* Books seats for trips.

&nbsp;  \* Pays via M-Pesa STK Push.

&nbsp;  \* Views live bus locations, trip history, and receipts.

\## 3. Functional Requirements



\### Authentication \& Accounts



\* \*\*FR1\*\*: Users sign up/login via phone number (Supabase Auth).

\* \*\*FR2\*\*: Admins manage manager/user accounts.

\* \*\*FR3\*\*: Unique IDs auto-generated for drivers:



&nbsp; \* Format: `DRV-XXXYYY`

&nbsp; \* Example: Driver 001 of Fleet RCS-051 â†’ `DRV-001051`.



\### Booking \& Payments



\* \*\*FR4\*\*: Passengers can book seats on available trips.

\* \*\*FR5\*\*: Payments processed via M-Pesa Daraja API (STK Push).

\* \*\*FR6\*\*: Payment confirmation stored \& receipts issued.



\### Vehicles \& Drivers



\* \*\*FR7\*\*: Managers register vehicles with details:



&nbsp; \* Fleet Number

&nbsp; \* License Plate

&nbsp; \* Capacity

&nbsp; \* GPS Device ID

&nbsp; \* SIM Number

&nbsp; \* GPS API Key

\* \*\*FR8\*\*: Managers assign drivers to vehicles.

\* \*\*FR9\*\*: System auto-links drivers and fleet numbers.



\### GPS Tracking



\* \*\*FR10\*\*: Vehicles publish GPS data in real time (via API/Webhook).

\* \*\*FR11\*\*: Users and managers view live vehicle locations on Mapbox.

\* \*\*FR12\*\*: Managers monitor trips in progress.



\### Admin \& Manager Tools



\* \*\*FR13\*\*: Managers can approve/reject trip logs.

\* \*\*FR14\*\*: Reports available in CSV (revenue, trips, drivers).

\* \*\*FR15\*\*: Admin can configure fares, routes, system settings.

\* \*\*FR16\*\*: Admin has kill-switch to block vehicles/users.



---



\## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)



\* \*\*NFR1\*\*: Supabase for backend (Auth, DB, Realtime).

\* \*\*NFR2\*\*: Minimal GPS latency with real-time subscriptions.

\* \*\*NFR3\*\*: Secure storage \& encryption of sensitive data (GPS keys, payments).

\* \*\*NFR4\*\*: System supports high concurrency (multiple trips \& payments).

\* \*\*NFR5\*\*: High availability for live tracking \& booking.

\* \*\*NFR6\*\*: Error handling for payment failures \& GPS outages.



---



\## 5. User Interfaces



\### Passenger App (PWA)



\* Login / Signup.

\* Seat booking \& M-Pesa payment.

\* Live map of matatus.

\* Trip history \& receipts.



\### Manager Dashboard (Web)



\* Driver \& vehicle management forms.

\* Live map of fleet.

\* Trip monitoring \& approval tools.

\* CSV reports.



\### Admin Panel (Web)



\* User \& manager management.

\* Route \& fare configuration.

\* Global reporting.

\* Kill-switch interface.



---



\## 6. Technical Architecture



\* \*\*Frontend\*\*: React (PWA for passengers, Web dashboards for managers/admins).

\* \*\*Backend\*\*: Python (FastAPI microservices).



&nbsp; \* Auth â†’ Supabase Auth.

&nbsp; \* Database â†’ Supabase PostgreSQL.

&nbsp; \* GPS Service â†’ integrates 3rd-party GPS API.

&nbsp; \* Payment Service â†’ M-Pesa Daraja API.

&nbsp; \* AI Service â†’ route optimization \& forecasting.

\* \*\*Infra\*\*:



&nbsp; \* Local Dev â†’ Docker.

&nbsp; \* Deployment â†’ Render (Docker support, CI/CD).

&nbsp; \* Maps â†’ Mapbox.

\* \*\*Data Flow\*\*:



&nbsp; \* Vehicles â†’ GPS API â†’ GPS Service â†’ Supabase Realtime â†’ Clients.

&nbsp; \* Payments â†’ Payment Service â†’ Supabase â†’ Receipts.

&nbsp; \* Reports â†’ Supabase SQL exports â†’ CSV.



---



\## 7. Testing Strategy



\* \*\*Unit Tests\*\*: All backend services.

\* \*\*Integration Tests\*\*: Payment + GPS API.

âœ… This is now a \*\*streamlined PRD\*\* â€” developers, product owners, or AI coding agents can pick it up and execute directly.



Do you want me to \*\*pair this PRD with a suggested monorepo folder structure\*\* (backend + frontend + infra + tests) so itâ€™s implementation-ready?
