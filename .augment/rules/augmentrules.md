- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** â€“ only use known, verified Python packages. 
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task.
Always use contect7 MCP for documentation and Playright MCP for e2e tests where relevant.
